# Unifying API and event driven architectures

## Description

Closed architectures are dead. But thereâ€™s a war going on : should architectures be API first to facilitate fail-fast one-to-one interactions or Event first to facilitate fan out interactions where eventual consistency is acceptable?
In this talk, I will describe the concept of AFEA (API first, Event always architectures) which allow:
- Designing services by first thinking in terms of API and events through strategic Domain Driven Design
- Enjoying the benefits of both APIs and events while mitigating their respective trade-offs
- Exposing APIs, web hooks and events in a single developer portal
