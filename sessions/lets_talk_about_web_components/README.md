# Let's Talk About Web Components

## Description

Before the dawn of some of the most popular frameworks (read: React and Vue), there was Web components. 
Web Components take one of the best parts of these frameworks (reusable components) and combine it with the best parts of web development (native browser support and not needing to set up a build process). As if that's not enough, web components allow you use the same functions across any framework. 

If at this point, you're wondering "If web components are so awesome, why haven't I heard about them before?", then you're in luck because that's exactly what this talk is about.

In this presentation, we'll take a look at what web components are, why web components are awesome, why web components can be a pain and how we can use web components both as a standalone tool and together with frameworks.
