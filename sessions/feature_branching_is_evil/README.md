# Feature Branching is Evil

## Description

Feature branching is still popular due to the rise of distributed version control systems but certainly also due to OSS and GitHub. Although branch creation has become extremely easy, it comes with a certain invisible cost. Branches break the flow of the IT delivery process, impacting stability and throughput.

The session explores why teams are using feature branches, what problems are introduced by using them and what techniques exist to avoid them altogether. It explores exactly what's evil about feature branches, which is not necessarily the problems they introduce - but rather, the real reasons why teams are using them.

After the session, you'll understand a different branching strategy and how it relates to Continuous Integration.
